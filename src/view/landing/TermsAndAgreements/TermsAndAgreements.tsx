                    <p>
                      Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure to
                      perform its obligations under this Agreement caused by
                      circumstances which are beyond the control of such Party,
                      which have arisen without the fault or negligence of the
                      foregoing and prevent it from due performance of its
                      obligation under this Agreement (“Force-majeure”), unless
                      the Party affected by such Force-majeure was or should
                      have been aware of the foregoing events and their
                      potential effect on its performance of the Agreement at
                      the time of its signing. Force majeure events include but
                      are not limited to: war (declared or undeclared), flood,
                      fire, earthquake or other natural disaster, military
                      actions, riot, civil commotion, government actions, acts
                      of God, fire, blockades, labor disturbances, strikes,
                      insurrections, earthquakes, acts of terrorism and other.
                      The suspension of performance may not be of longer
                      duration than is reasonably required given the nature of
                      the Force Majeure event. <br />
                      The affected party shall give the other Party a written
                      notice of the Force Majeure as soon as practicable
                      following such occurrence. The notice should include the
                      time when the event started and the expected duration of
                      its effect on the performance of this Agreement. As soon
                      as the affected Party is able to resume performance of the
                      obligations affected by the Force Majeure, such Party
                      shall give the other Party a written notice to that effect
                      and shall promptly resume performance hereunder. The
                      affected Party may not claim the Force majeure
                      circumstances as the reason for its non-performance under
                      this Agreement beyond the time period, during which the
                      event in question reasonably effects such performance.
