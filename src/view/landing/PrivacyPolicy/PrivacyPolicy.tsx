                    This Privacy Policy explains the practices and policies of
                    Azure Processing (“Azure Processing”, AZURE PAYMENTS
                    LIMITED) regarding the collection and protection of Personal
                    Data supplied by users or collected by us from users of
                    Azure Processing websites and the Azure Processing services
                    (the “Service”). <br />
                    Azure Processing defines “Personal Data” as any data from
                    which it is practical to directly determine the identity of
                    an individual. Any capitalized terms not defined in this
                    Privacy Policy have the meanings given in the Service’s
                    License and Service Agreement (the “User Agreement”). This
                    Privacy Policy may be updated by Azure Processing from time
                    to time. Azure Processing will provide notice of materially
                    significant changes to the Privacy Policy by posting notice
                    on its websites. <br />
                    By registering to use the Service, you agree (1) to comply
                    with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and (2)
                    Azure Processing may process (i.e., collect, use, etc.) your
                    Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy or the
                    Terms and Conditions. Personal Data may be processed by
                    Azure Processing in the country where it was collected as
                    well as other countries (including the United States) where
                    laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less
                    stringent. Please note that by visiting and using Azure
                    Processing’s website, you are accepting the practices
                    described in this Privacy Policy.

                    Visitors and Clients of the Site and Services may interact
                    with our Site in different ways. For example, Visitors are
                    people who may visit the Site but not necessarily sign up to
                    become a Client. We collect different information from
                    Visitors than Clients, and vice versa. <br />
                    Clients – Clients interact with the Site and Services in a
                    way which requires sending of application form so that the
                    Client may then upload and incorporate additional
                    information for use with the Services. Once you became the
                    Azure Processing Client, you are not anonymous to Azure
                    Processing. When signing up with Azure Processing, you
                    provide Personal Data, which may include company name,
                    industry, number of employees, phone number, your title,
                    city, state, country, zip code, a user name, confirmed email
                    address, and a password. Azure Processing may also record
                    your IP address when you submit information. Azure
                    Processing also may collect, at your option, certain
                    preference and demographic information from you. All
                    information collected by Azure Processing is used for
                    internal purposes of providing the Service, providing
                    support to users, and to improve services. Aggregating
                    non-identifying information supplied by users allows Azure
                    Processing to understand its user base and to improve
                    services. All Users may opt to remove their Personal Data
                    from our live database by contacting Azure Processing and
                    canceling their Azure Processing user account. Users of the
                    Azure Processing Services may also cancel their account at
                    any time by sending a cancellation request in writing,
                    either by mail or electronic mail. <br />
                    In addition to the information that we actively collect

                    Visitors – Visitors are people who do not actively provide
                    content to the Site or Services. However, as described
                    below, the site may still collect information from Visitors.
                    Any information gathered from Visitors is also gathered from
                    Clients. <br />
                    This information is restricted to cookies, IP addresses and
                    referral URLs, and other passive information gathering
                    devices, as explained below.

                    With that said, we also use portions of your information to

                    aggregate information, which may be collected both actively

                    to ensure the integrity and security of our network and
